## AI Daily Summary

The market is leaning towards a range-bound regime, but with low conviction at 49%, suggesting a cautious approach is warranted. Today's top signals are all neutral, offering no high-conviction entries for mean-reversion strategies in major tech or crypto. Existing long positions in BATL, JZ, and CISS remain flat; monitor these closely for a potential exit as they have shown no momentum. The key data point to watch is the 'Extreme Fear' in the crypto market, which can often precede significant volatility. Given the lack of clear signals, the focus should be on risk management of current positions rather than seeking new entries.
