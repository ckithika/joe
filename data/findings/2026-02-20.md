## AI Daily Summary

The market regime is tentatively range-bound, but with very low confidence, indicating a high potential for choppy, unpredictable price action. Today's primary signals are all neutral and weak, suggesting a lack of high-conviction entry points for mean-reversion strategies. Focus on position management; review the open longs in BATL, JZ, and particularly CISS for exit, as they are late in their hold periods with no profit. The key factor to watch is the crypto market, where sentiment is at 'Extreme Fear', which often precedes a significant price move or reversal.
