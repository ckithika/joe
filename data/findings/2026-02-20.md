## Top Signals
## AI Daily Summary

The market regime is a low-confidence `range_bound`, indicating a lack of clear direction and warranting a cautious stance. With no new signals generated today, we will not be initiating any new trades. The immediate priority is position management, as all open positions (BATL, JZ, CISS) have reached or exceeded their time-based stops and require closing. The crypto market is showing "Extreme Fear," which often precedes reversals, but this is a condition to monitor rather than act on without a signal. Our focus today is on disciplined position exits and capital preservation until market clarity improves.
