## AI Daily Summary

The market regime is an uncertain range-bound state, aligning with today's weak, neutral signals which all suggest mean-reversion strategies. While ETHUSD and BTCUSD are the top-ranked signals, their low conviction scores advise against initiating new trades today. The primary action is position management: focus on closing the CISS long position as it has reached its maximum 5-day holding period. The key element to monitor is the "Extreme Fear" sentiment in crypto, which could precede a sharp move, contrasting with our system's neutral readings.
